Because you are cloning a Github repository that only I can push to, you should **NOT EDIT** any of the files you pull from Github. Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or make a copy of this notebook and **save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `caobd_s19` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. **If you don't follow this advice your solutions may be overwritten and lost**."

    "This document is what we call a *Jupyter notebook*. We will be using these extensively throughout the course so **READ THIS CLOSELY**. There are two basic things you need to know about Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A notebook is nothing but a list of cells. A cell can either be a **code cell** or a **Markdown cell**. Code cells are for writing executable code, and Markdown cells (like this one) are for explaining things in text and making your notebook more readable. A typical workflow that you will soon get use to, is something like: solving a problem with some code in a *code cell* and explaining your reasoning or the results you obtained in a *Markdown cell*. You can toggle cell type when you are in *command mode* by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> for code and <kbd>m</kbd> for Markdown. **Try to do that**. Change this Markdown cell to a code cell, and change it back again. What happens if you execute (<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>) this cell as code cell, compared to when it is a Markdown cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The notebook has two *modes*: **edit mode** and **command mode**. You enter command mode by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> or clicking outside a cell, and edit mode by clicking a cell and pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> or double clicking a cell. When you're in edit mode, the outline of the current cell turns green (not with `jupyter lab`, though, there the bar is always blue)and whatever you type into your keyboard goes into that cell, whether it is a code or Markdown cell. [Here](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html)'s a nice rundown of the different commands you can use. **Beware of <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>d</kbd>**. Read the full list of hotkeys by pressing <kbd>h</kbd> in command mode to figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Heads up:* Because we'll be using Jupyter notebooks so much in this course, I strongly recommend investing 5 minutes more than you would normally, playing around with cell types, modes and hotkeys. It will save you heaps of time down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a code cell by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>, the code gets evaluated by the Python interpreter installed on your computer. The interpreter always returns some output, so unless you store it in a variable, it gets printed below the cell. In general, you will use code cells for doing analysis and working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Markdown* is a simple markup language for formatting text (similar to *HTML* or $\\LaTeX$, which you may know). You will typically use it for writing explanations about how you solve the exercises and the results you get, and styling your notebook with sections and subsections. It can do **bold**, *italics* and $\\LaTeX$ formatting (for equations), and much much more. You can read about the Markdown language [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is your first exercise. The exercise are numbered by the convention `[session]`.`[section]`.`[problem]`.`[subproblem]`. For example, exercise 4.2.3.1 is in week 4, section 2, problem 3, and subproblem 1."

She\\u2019s been diagnosed with colon cancer and has been given the next 2-3 months to live. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving her diagnosis and leaving the hospital she explained to Derrick, \\u201cI better live to see the end of GOT\\u201d. \\nIt broke my heart to hear someone get that short of a timeline and have her priorities be to just see the end of her favorite show. As the timeline she was given comes just short (I know the timelines are rough and people can make it a lot longer than what a  Dr can provide) of the premier, we are not sure if she\\u2019ll be able to see it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don\\u2019t know if this will be of any use but I thought that maybe if this gets enough attention she will be able to get her final wish. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1:Thank you all for the kind words, just be your comments you\\u2019ve made her day! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the petition to sign! &lt;a href=\\\"https://www.change.org/p/hbo-woman-with-colon-cancer-to-see-final-season-of-got-early?recruiter=627873605&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_term=tap_basic_sharehttps://\\\"&gt;https://www.change.org/p/hbo-woman-with-colon-cancer-to-see-final-season-of-got-early?recruiter=627873605&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_term=tap_basic_sharehttps://&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Angela, Derrick and I want to thank you all so much who have shared your kind words and generosity. She is absolutely thrilled with the progress of the petition and the growth of this post. You are all amazing. I tried to get to everyone today and I\\u2019ll pick up again tomorrow after some sleep. Thanks again from the bottom of our hearts. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n",
