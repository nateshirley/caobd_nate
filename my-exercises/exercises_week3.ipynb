Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol.

At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman\\'s face. Bill said, \\'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?\\' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: \\'Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous.\\' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn\\'t have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn\\'t leave fingerprints.<ref name=autogenerated1 />}}\\n\\n===Golden age===\\n\\n====Subsequent creation credit====\\nKane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say \"Batman created by Bob Kane\"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story\\'s actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a \"created by\" credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying \"Created by Bob Kane\" in addition to the other credits.\\n\\nFinger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman\\'s recurring villains. However, Finger\\'s contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, \"Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.\"<ref name=\"creation\" /> At the time of Finger\\'s death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.\\n\\n[[Jerry Robinson]], who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with \\'\\'[[The Comics Journal]]\\'\\':\\n{{quote|Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn\\'t sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why&nbsp;...

Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, \\'\\'[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]\\'\\'.\\n\\n====The New 52====\\n\\n{{See also|The New 52}}\\nIn September 2011, DC Comics\\' entire line of superhero comic books, including its \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' franchise, were canceled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of [[the New 52]] [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in [[Batman (comic book)|\\'\\'Batman\\'\\']], \\'\\'[[Detective Comics]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]\\'\\', and \\'\\'[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]\\'\\'. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman\\'s history remains mostly intact. \\'\\'Batman Incorporated\\'\\' was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the \"Leviathan\" storyline.\\n\\nWith the beginning of the New 52, [[Scott Snyder]] was the writer of the \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' title. His first major story arc was \"[[Night of the Owls]]\", where Batman confronts the [[Court of Owls]], a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was \"[[Death of the Family]]\", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was \"[[Batman: Zero Year]]\", which redefined Batman\\'s origin in The New 52. It followed \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character\\'s early years. The final storyline before the \"[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]\" (2015) storyline was \"[[Batman: Endgame|Endgame]]\", depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker\\'s supposed deaths.\\n\\nStarting with \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' vol. 2, #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce\\'s mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, robotic-Batman, debuting in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] special comic \\'\\'Divergence\\'\\'. However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend, [[Julie Madison]], but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a \"strange star\" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor. Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shut down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/23/scott-snyder-and-greg-capullo-batman-50-interview |title=Batman\\'s Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo on the New Batsuit and Bloom\\'s Identity |author=Joshua Yehl |date=March 23, 2016 |work=IGN |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423225606/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/23/scott-snyder-and-greg-capullo-batman-50-interview |archivedate=April 23, 2016 }}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2015, DC Comics released \\'\\'[[The Dark Knight III: The Master Race (comic)|The Dark Knight III: The Master Race]]\\'\\', the sequel to Frank Miller\\'s \\'\\'The Dark Knight Returns\\'\\' and \\'\\'The Dark Knight Strikes Again\\'\\'.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/arts/dark-knight-iii-the-master-race-comic-book-prompts-reflection-and-a-look-ahead.html |title=\\'Dark Knight III: The Master Race\\' Comic Book Prompts Reflection and a Look Ahead |date=November 23, 2015 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126023014/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/arts/dark-knight-iii-the-master-race-comic-book-prompts-reflection-and-a-look-ahead.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 }}</ref>\\n\\n====DC Universe====\\n\\nIn June 2016, the [[DC Rebirth]] event relaunched DC Comics\\' entire line of comic book titles. \\'\\'[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]\\'\\' was rebooted as starting with a one-shot issue entitled \\'\\'Batman: Rebirth\\'\\' #1 (Aug. 2016).

Dennis O\\'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: \"[[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]] did a Batman in \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' and \\'\\'Detective\\'\\' and [[Murray Boltinoff]] did a Batman in the \\'\\'Brave and the Bold\\'\\' and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days.\"<ref>Pearson; Uricchio. \"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O\\'Neil\" p. 23.</ref>\\n\\nThe driving force behind Bruce Wayne\\'s character is his parents\\' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman\\'s background and decided that \"there\\'s nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes\".<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 31.</ref> Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Detective Comics #33 (Nov. 1939), Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Batman #1 Spring 1940, Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref> and to train his body into physical perfection<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne\\'s insight into the criminal mind.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\\n\\nAnother of Batman\\'s characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman\\'s origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the \"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions\".<ref>{{harvp|Pearson|Uricchio|1991|p=194}}</ref> The origin is the source of the character\\'s traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character\\'s adventures.<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\" />\\n\\nBatman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories.

Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: \"Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman\\'s partner since he was a kid, he\\'s led the [[Teen Titans]], and he\\'s trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he\\'s a very different kind of Batman.

[[Jean Paul Valley]], also known as [[Azrael]], assumed the cowl after the events of the \\'\\'[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\\'\\' saga.<ref name=\"visual\"/> [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] donned a mech-suit after the events of \\'\\'[[Batman: Endgame]]\\'\\', and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016.\\n\\nAdditionally, members of the group [[Batman, Incorporated]], Bruce Wayne\\'s experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world.<ref name=\"visual\"/> Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.\\n\\n==Supporting characters==\\n{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}\\n\\nBatman\\'s interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\" />\\n\\n===Adversaries===\\n[[File:BatmanRoguesGallery.jpg|thumb|Batman surrounded by his enemies. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]\\n{{Main|List of Batman Family adversaries}}\\n\\nBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman\\'s character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.<ref name = \"Boichel_p8\"/> These foes are commonly referred to as Batman\\'s \\'\\'[[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]]\\'\\'. Batman\\'s \"most implacable foe\" is the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a \"personification of the irrational\", the Joker represents \"everything Batman [opposes]\".<ref name = \"Boichel_p9\"/> Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman\\'s rogues gallery include [[Catwoman]] (a [[burglary|cat burglar]] antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Ra\\'s al Ghul]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Clayface]], and [[Killer Croc]] among others. Many of Batman\\'s adversaries are often psychiatric patients at [[Arkham Asylum]].\\n\\n===Allies===\\n\\n;Alfred\\n{{Main|Alfred Pennyworth}}\\nBatman\\'s butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], first appeared in \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne\\'s loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents\\' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character \"[lends] a homely touch to Batman\\'s environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand\" to the hero and his sidekick.<ref name = \"Boichel_p8\">Boichel, p. 8.</ref>\\n\\n;\"Batman Family\"\\nThe informal name \"[[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman family]]\" is used for a group of characters closely allied with Batman, generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. They include: [[Barbara Gordon]], Commissioner Gordon\\'s daughter, who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of [[Batgirl]] and, during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Oracle; [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]] and as Batgirl for a brief stint; [[Cassandra Cain]], the daughter of professional assassins [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], and [[Lady Shiva]], who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.\\n\\n;Civilians\\n[[Lucius Fox]], a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne\\'s business manager who is well aware of his employer\\'s clandestine vigilante activities; [[Leslie Thompkins|Dr. Leslie Thompkins]], a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; [[Vicki Vale]], an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman\\'s activities for the Gotham Gazette; [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], Batman\\'s canine partner who was mainly active in the 1950s and 1960s;<ref name=\"138D\">Daniels (1995), p. 138.</ref> and [[Bat-Mite]], an extra-dimensional imp mostly active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.<ref name=\"138D\" />\\n\\n;GCPD\\n{{main|Gotham City Police Department}}\\n\\nAs Batman\\'s ally in the Gotham City police, [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (comics)|James \"Jim\" Gordon]] debuted along with Batman in \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting [[everyman]], he shares Batman\\'s goals while offering, much as the character of [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] does in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, a normal person\\'s perspective on the work of Batman\\'s extraordinary genius.\\n\\n;Justice League\\n{{main|Justice League}}\\n\\nBatman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of \\'\\'World\\'s Finest\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Superman/Batman]]\\'\\' series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In \\'\\'[[Superman/Batman]]\\'\\' #3 (Dec. 2003), [[Superman]] observes, \"Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind.

In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero [[Nightwing]]. A second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker\\'s old persona, the [[Red Hood]], and became an [[antihero]] vigilante with no qualms about using [[firearms]] or [[deadly force]]. [[Carrie Kelly]], the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller\\'s graphic novels \\'\\'[[The Dark Knight Returns]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]\\'\\', fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.\\n\\nThe third Robin in mainstream comics is [[Tim Drake]], who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]], a variation on the traditional Robin persona.

Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection.\\n\\nIn an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during \\'\\'[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]\\'\\'. The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In \\'\\'[[Batman: Dark Victory]]\\'\\', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called \"[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]\", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, \"Hush\" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In \"\\'Hush\", Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.\\n\\nThe [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world, partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Selina Kyle, as shown in \\'\\'[[Superman Family]]\\'\\' #211.

Superman describes Batman as \"the most dangerous man on Earth\", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison\\'s first storyline in \\'\\'JLA.\\'\\'\\n\\nBatman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of [[telepathy]] and [[mind control]]. He is a master of [[disguise]], multilingual, and an expert in [[espionage]], often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and [[escapology]], which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] with little to no harm.\\n\\nBatman is an expert in [[interrogation]] techniques and his [[intimidation|intimidating]] and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman\\'s most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].\\n\\nAmong physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the [[Batplane]]), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.\\n\\nIn the comic, The Many Deaths of the Batman which focused on a former demolitions teacher of Batman who killed Batman\\'s other teachers which included a race car driver, chemist, body builder, and gymnast all of whom were experts in their field.\\n\\n===Technology===\\nBatman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman\\'s arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the \"Batgyro\" in \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #31 and #32 (Sept., Oct. 1939).<ref name = \"vapzdg\"/>\\n\\n;Personal armor\\n{{Main|Batsuit}}\\nBatman\\'s [[body armor]]ed costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.<ref name=\"A1\">Daniels (1999)</ref> The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists\\' interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.<ref name=\"A1\" /> Hence, the costume\\'s colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey;<ref name=\"A1\" /> as well as black and grey. In the [[Tim Burton]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Batman Returns]]\\'\\' films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. [[Christopher Nolan]]\\'s \\'\\'[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]\\'\\' depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. [[Ben Affleck]]\\'s Batman in the [[DC Extended Universe]] films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.\\n\\nBatman\\'s [[batsuit]] aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]]. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 98.</ref> The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl\\'s ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O\\'Neil said, \"We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don\\'t have to look the same&nbsp;... Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.\"<ref>Daniels (1999), pp. 159–60.</ref>\\n\\n;Batmobile\\n{{main|Batmobile}}\\n[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile, built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]]]]\\nBatman\\'s primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] that suggest a bat\\'s wings. Batman also has an aircraft called the [[Batplane]] (later called the \"Batwing\"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper practice, the \"bat\" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|\\'\\'Batman\\'\\' live-action television show]] and the \\'\\'[[Super Friends]]\\'\\' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]], among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such \"bat-\" names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline \"A Death in the Family\" suggests that given Batman\\'s grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the \"bat\" prefix on his own. In \\'\\'[[The Dark Knight Returns]]\\'\\', Batman tells [[Carrie Kelley]] that the original Robin came up with the name \"Batmobile\" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman\\'s vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched]] its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.\\n\\n;Utility belt\\n{{main|Batman\\'s utility belt}}\\nBatman keeps most of his field equipment in his [[Batman\\'s utility belt|utility belt]]. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman\\'s equipment are [[gun]]s, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents\\' murder.\\n\\n;Bat-Signal\\n{{Main|Bat-Signal}}\\nWhen Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.\\n\\nIn various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|\\'\\'Batman\\'\\' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman\\'s residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne\\'s study and the extension phone in the Batcave.\\n\\n;Batcave\\n{{Main|Batcave}}\\nThe Batcave is Batman\\'s secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]]. As his command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman\\'s unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on. In both the comic \\'\\'[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]\\'\\' #45 and the 2005 film \\'\\'[[Batman Begins]]\\'\\', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nBatman\\'s history has undergone many [[retroactive continuity]] revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character\\'s history have varied greatly. Scholars [[William Uricchio]] and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, \"Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.\"<ref>\\'\\'Batman Annual\\'\\' vol. 3, #2 (Jan. 2018)</ref>\\n\\n===20th century===\\n\\n====Origin====\\n[[File:Thomas Wayne 1939.png|thumb|right|[[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] are shot by Joe Chill in \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #33 (Nov. 1939).

Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, \"Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\",<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\">Pearson; Uricchio. \"\\'I\\'m Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.\\'\" p. 186.</ref> a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O\\'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.<ref name=\"pearson pg 191\">Pearson, p. 191.</ref>\\n\\n====Golden age====\\n{{See also|Batman (Earth-Two)}}\\nIn Batman\\'s first appearance in \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story=The Case of the Chemical Syndicate|title=Detective Comics #27|date=May 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Batman\\'s origin is first presented in \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #33 (Nov. 1939) and is later expanded upon in \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible&nbsp;...\" As if responding to his desires, a [[bat]] suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics #33|date=Nov. 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\\n\\nIn early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police.

Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the golden and silver ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.\\n\\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics\\' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the golden age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle. The two have a daughter, [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham\\'s protector along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]], once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the golden age.<ref>One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #1</ref> Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #208, Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=235|date=Sept. 1956|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=226|date=Dec. 1955|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> In 1980 then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the \\'\\'Untold Legend of the Batman\\'\\' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history.\\n\\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the silver age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in \\'\\'[[World\\'s Finest Comics]]\\'\\', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], Batman appears in its first story, in 1960\\'s \\'\\'[[Brave and the Bold]]\\'\\' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, \\'\\'Brave and the Bold\\'\\' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.\\n\\n====Bronze age====\\nIn 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early golden age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra\\'s al Ghul]], a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman\\'s secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes [[Nightwing]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\\n\\nIn the final issue of \\'\\'Brave and the Bold\\'\\' in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He serves as the team\\'s leader until \\'\\'Batman and the Outsiders\\'\\' #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\\n\\n====Modern age====\\nAfter the 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] \\'\\'Crisis on Infinite Earths\\'\\', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline \"[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]\" from \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Miller (comics)| author2 = [[David Mazzucchelli]] |author3=Richmond Lewis | title =[[Batman: Year One]] | publisher = DC Comics| year = 1987 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-1-85286-077-6}}</ref> Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s silver-age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of golden-age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following \\'\\'Crisis\\'\\', DC launched a new Batman title called \\'\\'[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]\\'\\' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period.\\n\\nSubsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-fighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when [[Tim Drake]] becomes the new Robin.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|penciller=[[Norm Breyfogle]]|story=Master of Fear|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=457|date=Dec. 1990|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\\n\\nMany of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\". During the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.<ref>Dixon, Chuck. et al. \"Batman: Prodigal\". \\'\\'Batman\\'\\' 512–514, \\'\\'Shadow of the Bat\\'\\' 32–34, \\'\\'Detective Comics\\'\\' 679–681, \\'\\'Robin\\'\\' 11–13. New York: DC Comics, 1995.</ref>\\n\\nThe 1994 company-wide crossover storyline \"[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]\" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.\\n\\nBatman once again becomes a member of the [[Justice League]] during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled \\'\\'JLA\\'\\'. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"[[No Man\\'s Land (comics)|No Man\\'s Land]]\".\\n\\nMeanwhile, Batman\\'s relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of \"Batman: Officer Down\" and \"Batman: War Games/War Crimes\"; Batman\\'s long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] are forced out of the police department in \"Officer Down\", while \"War Games\" and \"War Crimes\" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City\\'s criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] the undisputed ruler of the city\\'s criminal gangs. [[Lex Luthor]] arranges for the murder of Batman\\'s on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]\" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as \"Checkmate\" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state\\'s evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from [[Talia al Ghul]] in \\'\\'[[Superman/Batman]]\\'\\' #1–6.\\n\\n===21st century===\\n\\n====2000s====\\nDC Comics\\' 2005 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] \\'\\'[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]\\'\\' reveals that JLA member [[Zatanna]] had edited Batman\\'s memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after he raped [[Sue Dibny]]. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman\\'s creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle\\'s death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the \\'\\'[[Infinite Crisis]]\\'\\' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.\\n\\nFollowing \\'\\'Infinite Crisis\\'\\', Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\".<ref>\"Infinite Crisis\" #7, p. 32</ref> In the \\'\\'[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]\\'\\' storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence.
